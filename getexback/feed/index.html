				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re devastated because you want to <strong>get her back</strong> but she doesn&#8217;t want to be with you anymore. You&#8217;re left sitting there wondering where you went wrong. Continuously replaying events in your mind. What could you have done differently? Well, I&#8217;ve got news for you and I think deep down you know it&#8217;s true: <em>you were responsible for the break-up</em>, and I&#8217;ll tell you why&#8230;</p>
<p>But first, understand that<strong> getting her back</strong> requires you know how female attraction works in the first place. Asking a woman what she&#8217;s attracted to won&#8217;t get you an honest answer because they don&#8217;t really know themselves what they actually respond to on a deep,  psychological level.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to get her back the real way:</p>
<p><strong>1. Rediscover yourself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Have fun.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Start dating.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breakups suck. Especially that last bit, depending on how long you guys dragged it out. The lack of caring. Picking at each other for no good reason. Maybe she even started openly flirting with other guys (you know, like laughing at their stupid jokes and hitting them playfully). Coming up with excuses not to hang out as much&#8230; Lack of sex. You know the story. It&#8217;s pretty much the same one for everyone with only slight variation.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve already Googled &#8220;how to get my girlfriend back&#8221; or something to that effect. The truth is, there&#8217;s lots of misinformation out there. Lots of free, crappy information and lots of outdated products you should stay away from. There are a few good ones though, but the majority are crap. Just being honest.</p>
<p>If you want a good starting place, get the basics down first.</p>
<p>That means you need to stop acting desperate. I get it, you loved her, but clearly the feeling is not mutual, otherwise she&#8217;d be with you right now. And she&#8217;s not. Stop texting her all the bloody time. Stop calling her. Stop apologizing (assuming you didn&#8217;t do anything substantially wrong). Stop supplicating toward her right this minute! This demonstrates lower value and women don&#8217;t respond to guys like that.</p>
<p>The reason she gave you for the breakup is almost certainly not the real reason. The real reason is simple: She lost attraction for you. Either she didn&#8217;t want to overtly say this and hurt your feelings, or she herself doesn&#8217;t fully understand.</p>
<p>For you right now, the key is to limit contact with your ex or depending on the dynamic, eliminate contact altogether for about three weeks. You want to throw her off balance by mixing up your pattern a bit. If you text her &#8220;I love you&#8221; every night, stop. In fact, after a breakup you shouldn&#8217;t be saying &#8220;I love you&#8221; at all, unless you completely fucked up and cheated on her or something like that. You want to switch up the pattern she&#8217;s grown accustomed to.</p>
<p>Now I really want you to sit down and think about the person you were when you guys first started dating. Ask yourself what changed? How did you go from being the guy you once were to what you are now (probably a groveling fool). Sorry, I don&#8217;t mean to insult you, I&#8217;ve been where you are too. Everybody has at one point or another.</p>
<p>You want to change yourself back to the person you were. There guy she was attracted to in the beginning. The guy she fell in love with. Maybe you added a few notches to your belt? Maybe you went from being a confident guy to handing your balls over to her in a neatly wrapped box with a bow on top? I see that sort of thing all the time.</p>
<p>Search your soul. Only YOU can figure out in what way you changed that would cause her to lose interest in you. I don&#8217;t know you.</p>
<p>And finally, get a life. Most guys in relationships (the ones who get dumped) tend to drift toward making the woman the center of their universe. Bad idea. Once she HAS you completely, there is no longer any interest. It&#8217;s like a cat chasing a toy. Once the cat catches the toy, not long after it loses interest.</p>
<p>So get your old life back. Go out with the guys and have a few beers at your local favorite pub. Go on dates again, buy some killer new clothes, and above all else, start valuing yourself again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every woman knows the pain of a breakup: sleepless nights wondering <strong>how to get your ex boyfriend back</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>If your feelings have not abated for your love or spouse you may find yourself spending endless hours trying to find a way to get your ex back.</p>
<p>Friends will be perhaps the first source of advice for you. They will give their views and advice on how they would go about getting your ex back. Countless hours will be spent over lunch, drinks, coffee and on the phone, figuring out what your ex is up to and how to get her or him back.</p>
<p>Because you probably have more than one friend, you will most likely get more than one theory or plan on how to get your ex back.</p>
<p>Your mother may even chime in or perhaps your pool man, mailman. hairdresser, mechanic, neighbor, dry cleaner, and dog groomer, will all pitch in their 2 cents.</p>
<p>After a few weeks you will now have perhaps a dozen different “ways” to get your ex back.</p>
<p>The problem with the vast collection you have assembled is that they are ALL WRONG! Well meaning, perhaps, but inexperience can mean disaster for you and finish once and for all any effort to get your ex back.</p>
<p>This is sad, because it really is possible to get your ex back, if you understand what is going on and approach your ex with appropriate attitudes, language, and actions.</p>
<p>Every friend, family member and associate who is doling out information on how to get your ex back is doing so based on what they tried, what they saw in a movie, read in a magazine, watched on a daytime TV show or derived from some other venue.</p>
<p>Which one of these inexperienced advice pals are you going to stake such an important decision on, that of how to get your ex back?</p>
<p>Just don’t do it.</p>
<p>To get your ex back you need a step by step approach that is based on real life experience and is proven to work.</p>
<p>Your ex may have a new love, may be remarried, playing the field, playing no field at all, living down the street, or moved to Alaska and you live in Florida.</p>
<p>Every type of relationship demands different methodologies for successfully winning the heart of your ex back permanently.</p>
<p>Only an expert can provide advice tailored to your specific situation.</p>
<p>There are however a few rules that should be followed if you truly want to get your ex back</p>
<p><strong>1) Don’t Beg</strong> &#8211; The more you beg your ex to come back, the less likely it is to ever occur. People are funny. They tend to want what they don’t or can’t have more than what they have without challenge.</p>
<p><strong>2) Don’t Give Ultimatums</strong> &#8211; Comments such as “ leave me and I’ll date your sister, jump off the roof, run away and join the Navy”, all make you look silly. They don’t make you desirable, just a fool. Use ultimatums and your ex may help you pack….and off to the Navy you’ll go !</p>
<p><strong>3) Become Active in Something</strong> &#8211; By taking the focus off your ex and seeing the world in a different perspective you will demonstrate your independence, desirability, charm and those things that made you desirable to your ex in the first place. Get active in your community, join a club, go to church, join friends on a camping trip or start hiking with your dog.</p>
<p>She or he, will soon hear that you are doing just fine and will soon wonder why they broke up with you….and maybe even get a little jealous. Do this and retake charge of your relationship, whatever stage your at.</p>
