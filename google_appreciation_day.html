     <p>Google 
        Appreciation Day is an event that officially occurs on the <b>14th</b> <b>of
          September</b>. This date is significant because “<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google.com</a>” was 
        registered on September 14th.<br>
        <br>
        Google Appreciation Day's main purpose is to better the lives of those who 
        celebrate it by encouraging the acquisition of knowledge, which will eventually 
        lead to the betterment of one's life.<br>
        <br>
        Participants can spend as little as five minutes to as long as 24 hours 
        researching an area of their life they wish to improve upon (as long as the 
        knowledge gained can actually be applied to bettering your life). For 
        example, if one wishes to lose weight, he/she would spend time searching 
        Google for various weight loss techniques and strategies. The individual 
        would continue doing so until a satisfactory amount of information had been 
        obtained on the subject. However, it is not enough to merely obtain the 
        knowledge; one must actually apply what he/she has learned in an effort to 
        better their life.<br>
        <hr>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step #1</span> <br>
        Sit down and seriously think about your life. Ask yourself: “If I could 
        change anything about my life, without the chance of failure, what would it 
        be?” Write down what comes to mind.<br>
        <br>
        Some examples would include: Bettering your financial standing, losing 
        weight, learning a specific skill such as guitar and learning various 
        leadership strategies. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step #2</span> <br>
        Surf on over to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com">
          www.google.com</a> and begin researching the area of your life you wish to 
        better. We recommend you bookmark all quality sites in their own folder. You 
        may even wish to keep a text file open and paste all relevant information 
        in there. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step #3</span> <br></p>
        <p>Put your newly acquired knowledge into good use and APPLY what you have learned. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Google Appreciation Day is not about a specific day in and of itself, but 
        rather it is about reminding us that most aspects of our life are within our 
        individual control and that they can be changed if one so chooses. So, every 
        time the 14th of September rolls around, use it as an opportunity to learn something 
        useful.<br>
        <br>
&quot;The key to happiness in life is to focus on that which we can control, and 
        forget about the rest.&quot;</p>
