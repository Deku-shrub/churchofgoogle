					The Cold Hard Facts!<p>Well, what have you gone and done. 
					You’ve made a right old mess of things, haven’t you. So you 
					want to know how to get your ex girlfriend back? Everything 
					was going along so well, you’d been together for ages and 
					what happens? She ‘does the bolt’.</p>
					<p>It doesn’t matter whose fault it was, and it really 
					doesn’t matter what led up to it. All that matters is “How 
					do you get your ex-girlfriend back?”</p>
					<ul>
						<i>So how DO you get your ex girlfriend back?</i></ul>
					<p>Well the first thing that you don’t do is something 
					stupid. You don’t go out on the town with your mates. 
					They’ll lend a sympathetic ear and show you a good time, but 
					you’ll all end up half cut and they’ll “try to help” by 
					introducing you to a ‘lovely’ lady in the bar and you know 
					what’ll happen next, don’t you?</p>
					<p>That’s right – guilt, just to add to all your other 
					problems. Let alone the hassle of trying to get out of bed, 
					get dressed and get out of the house without waking her! 
					That, my friend, is an art that takes a long time in the 
					making. Look at you, you’re a wreck. You’ve no idea what to 
					do next. Not a clue. You can’t concentrate on anything, you 
					don’t even care about anything and to be perfectly honest, 
					you are boring everyone to tears. Sure, everyone feels sorry 
					for you, but you have to do something constructive.</p>
					<p>Making constant ‘phone calls and sending hundreds of text 
					messages is NOT constructive. Nor are hip expanding boxes of 
					chocolates. Tasty, no doubt, but in these circumstances, 
					less than useless. What you’ve got to do, and I know that 
					this will be difficult, is to harness what little you have 
					left of your “brain power” if you ever want to find out how 
					to get your ex girlfriend back. Not only getting her back, 
					but getting her begging to come back. And she will. But only 
					if you play your cards right.</p>
					<p>Although you may well feel the need to call her ten times 
					per day, this is only going to make her see you as needy. 
					It's going to turn her off, even if she feels sorry enough 
					for you to carry on taking those calls.</p>
					<p>Make sure that you cut off all communication until you 
					know what plan of action you are going to use. Think things 
					through, are you acting out of pride or real, true desire to 
					be back with your ex girlfriend? Knowing what you truly want 
					is the first step you should be taking. Take the time out to 
					really sit down and think about what you want. If pride is 
					driving you, then you really shouldn't be treating her as 
					your possession.</p>
					<p><b>Here’s what you DO have to do.</b> You have to stop 
					running around like a headless chook chasing its own tail.
					<i>{Yes, I know it’s a mixed metaphor, but who’s writing 
					this article?}</i> Remember, I’m the one who’s trying to 
					show you how to get your ex girlfriend back.</p>
					<p>You have to make a cup of coffee, not a beer, a cup of 
					coffee, get some paper and a pen, sit quietly, no TV, and 
					work out a few things.</p>
					<p>You have, firstly, to work out why she left in the first 
					place. Make a list of things that you did that she was 
					always mentioning. They might not seem important things to 
					you, but women are funny creatures. Always remember, Women 
					and cats will do as they please. Men and dogs should relax 
					and get used to the idea.</p>
					<p>Did she always comment about your smoking in the house? 
					Maybe she didn’t nag about it, but it was obviously on her 
					mind. OK, stop smoking in the house, better still,
					<a id="link_76" target="_new" href="http://www.grumpyoldchef.com/product.php?products_id=137">
					give up smoking</a> altogether. This will impress her no 
					end.</p>
					<p>The most heinous crime that any man can commit, in the 
					eyes of a woman, is to leave the toilet seat up. Truly and 
					without a doubt, this has been the cause of countless 
					relationship break-ups.</p>
					<p>Practice lowering the toilet seat. It’s quite easy once 
					you get the hang of it. Grab the top of the toilet seat with 
					your right hand and gently lower it. Don’t drop it or it 
					will make a very loud crash and frighten the cat. There, 
					that was not too difficult, was it? Now, about going to bed 
					with your boots on…</p>
					<p>Your list may be short or it may be long, but what you 
					have to do is change these “bad habits” BEFORE you try to 
					win her back.</p>
					<p>It’s no use at all ringing her up and saying “I’ll 
					change”. You have to change first, THEN ring her up, 
					casually, and have a chat, mention in passing that you’ve 
					stopped smoking etc. How you’re going to bring the toilet 
					seat into a casual conversation is your problem, not mine.</p>
					<p>Don’t be in too much of a hurry to make contact. I know 
					it’s hard, but two can play the “hard-to-get” card. If you 
					wait for a few weeks and master the toilet seat thing, when 
					you do call her, the call will be greeted, not with 
					annoyance, but with relief on her part. After all, she may 
					have given you the elbow, but she’ll still be wondering how 
					you’re going.</p>
					<p>Now you’re starting to get the upper hand. But you still 
					need help. Big time help.</p>
					<p>You do deserve to be a winner, don’t you?<br>
