								When a relationship with a wife or girlfriend 
								feels as if it is falling apart, it most likely 
								is falling apart and this is the time to stop 
								and take an honest assessment. Listening to our 
								inner feelings is essential in every type of 
								relationship because feelings are an armor of 
								protection. Feelings cause us to question life 
								and often our failure to succeed directly 
								relates to those feelings or gut warnings we 
								ignore.<p>Feelings are red flags, they are 
								warnings, which save us from mistakes when we 
								pay attention and deal with them. This is not 
								always a simple task and sometimes it causes 
								emotional pain, which is often the basic reason 
								we refuse to face our feelings and try to ignore 
								them. We do not want to experience feelings of 
								pain, but the road to renewed joy in a 
								relationship lies in our willingness to 
								experience pain.</p>
								<p>We can never experience the feelings of joy, 
								which come with pain relief, if we refuse to 
								make the effort to learn the cause of the pain. 
								Taking the wrong medication or no medication 
								does not take away the pain. People who suffer 
								from migraine headaches learn to recognize the 
								signs at the onset of what can become a 
								debilitating headache. In a relationship, we 
								must begin to recognize the signs and symptoms 
								of the heartache, which can come when we fail to 
								respond to feelings of discomfort in a 
								relationship. Only by being willing to stop, 
								look and listen to our inner self, can we 
								prevent an exacerbation of a crack in a 
								relationship.</p>
								<p>Feelings are similar to a leaky faucet, which 
								if we do not take the time to fix or seek help 
								from someone who can fix the leak it will get 
								much worse. In the end, the leaking faucet can 
								cause us an unexpected and much larger expense, 
								than if we had responded to the faucet when we 
								first noticed the leak. This all seems perhaps 
								unrelated to loosing a wife or girlfriend, but 
								it is a simple reality, many people train 
								themselves to ignore their inner feelings, which 
								cause discomfort, and attempt to ignore these 
								feeling hoping they will go away.</p>
								<p>Unresolved inner conflict, which is what 
								negative feelings are, will never go away unless 
								we give them the attention they demand. 
								Sometimes we are simply being paranoid, but most 
								of the time the feelings are legitimate and 
								there is a justifiable reason for them. Most of 
								the time, we need to adjust our thought process. 
								Rarely do these feelings come from the actions 
								or lack of action on the part of another.<br>
