							When you girlfriend up and breaks up with you, 
							usually it's not for nothing. Women may sometimes 
							SEEM a little random and unpredictable, but for the 
							most part they do things for a reason. Chances are, 
							that reason in this case is you...and I'm going to 
							help you find out why and possibly how to fix it and 
							get your life back on track.<p>There are several 
							things that make a woman want to leave her man, but 
							three in particular tend to come up more often than 
							any others. If she didn't tell you why she broke up 
							with you and you haven't figured it out yourself, 
							I'm going to list off these three main reasons so 
							you can check your situation against any of them and 
							hopefully figure out what you did wrong.</p>
							<p>1) Number One is a big one, and while it's really 
							not the most common of the three, it's the most 
							severe of them. Chances are, you'll also KNOW that 
							it's why she left, but I'll list it anyways. First 
							on the list for when a girl will leave her guy is 
							when the guy has another girl on the side.</p>
							<p>If this is the case for you, I can't say that I 
							have a whole lot of sympathy for you, but I suppose 
							even really stupid things can be done by mistake. 
							I'm sorry to say though that a relationship 
							shattered by a cheating partner is probably the 
							hardest to heal. A lot of trust gets broken, and 
							your girlfriend probably won't just be heartbroken 
							but also really kind of hate you. Getting over 
							that's going to be pretty hard.</p>
							<p>2) The second big mistake guys make with their 
							girls is not giving them the emotional support they 
							need. Women are wired a little differently than we 
							are, and it's very important that they feel cared 
							for. If a guy isn't meeting their emotional needs, 
							girls will seek companionship from someone who can.</p>
							<p>If your girlfriend broke up with you for this 
							reason, it's a bit easier to remedy than if you had 
							done the big no-no with another woman. A lot easier, 
							in fact. This is a problem you can address within 
							yourself by paying more attention to the girl, and 
							really showing how much you care about what she has 
							to say. Every girl is a little different, but if you 
							really pay attention to her she usually gives you 
							all the info you need to make her happy.</p>
							<p>3) Another of the big problems that really holds 
							true for guys and girls is letting the relationship 
							get too boring. When everything gets really 
							predictable and there isn't too much entertainment 
							in the relationship, your partner can get bored and 
							the spark can kind of &quot;go out.&quot; This isn't to say 
							that your girlfriend doesn't still love you, but 
							when there's little reason other than that to really 
							hang around, why would she?</p>
							<p>Maybe you can't help it if you're not the most 
							creative when it comes to finding new things to do 
							to have fun, but seriously come on...there's an 
							entire world of things to do out there, and you 
							obviously have access to the Internet if you're 
							reading this. With all of the Web at your disposal, 
							you can find things to do with your girlfriend that 
							are fun and exciting. There's no reason to let any 
							relationship get stale enough to cause someone to 
							lose interest.</p>
							<p>These are only a few of the top reasons why most 
							relationships fail...there are a lot more, but to 
							list everything that's ever caused a relationship 
							problem would be written in volumes, not paragraphs. 
							These are the main things to look for and avoid if 
							possible, and they should help to keep your 
							relationship healthy. Good luck!<br>
