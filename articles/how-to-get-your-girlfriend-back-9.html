										You lost your loved one. Now you want 
										your partner back in your life.<p>Are 
										you now wondering on how to get your ex 
										back with you? I wrote this article that 
										will definitely help you in this task. 
										Being the only one working for a 
										resolution can be a tough job, but even 
										if now you see all black, you can get 
										your ex back.</p>
										<p><strong>Some tips first:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Be yourself. Do not act like 
											someone else just to be liked. It 
											might works at the beginning, but in 
											the long run is a losing strategy.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Take your time and think before 
											you do something, you need to 
											understand what the body language is 
											telling. You do not want to look 
											desperate.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Do not be rude with your ex 
											partner friends. You are just 
											slimming down the chances to get 
											your loved one back with you again.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Do not beg your ex, demand 
											her/him to get back with you, and 
											never be obnoxious . That will never 
											work, never do this to any person.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Do not try to stay in touch with 
											your ex. You just broke up, the last 
											thing you want to do is to annoy 
											your ex partner. And because you 
											broke up this means that somebody 
											need some time alone.</li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>What steps can you take to 
										get your ex back?</strong></p>
										<ol>
											<li>Consider why you broke up in the 
											first place. Do you really want your 
											ex love back or do you just want 
											something also if you do not need 
											it? Was one (or both) of you 
											abusive, mean, or possessive? Did 
											one (or both) cheat? If any of these 
											things happened, you better consider 
											if that kind of relationship is 
											really for you.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Be the person he or she felt in 
											love with. At the beginning your 
											beloved one was attracted to you 
											because of how you made your 
											companion feel good, and you both 
											believed that spending the time 
											together was great. Did you changed 
											your behaviour? If you spot any 
											mistake you made correct them.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Be Positive when you see your 
											ex. Laugh and smile, everybody love 
											to have happy people around.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Use what you learned in the past 
											to your advantage. You know for sure 
											that one of your outfit was a 
											his/her favourite? Where them again. 
											Or share a wonderful moment you had 
											together.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Invite him/her to talk to you. 
											Let your ex know that you regret 
											that things were not going so well 
											between you and your ex, and let 
											him/her know that you are changing 
											your behaviour.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Let your ex love know you were 
											thinking about him/her. Remember 
											when you had a fabulous time at that 
											special place? Leave him/her a short 
											notice telling you have been there 
											recently and you thought about 
											him/her all the time. Of course 
											accidentally ask him how he is 
											doing. This is a non-threatening way 
											to contact your ex love again.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Pay a little attention to your 
											appearance if you have been 
											neglecting yourself in that field.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
											<li>Give a lot of value to yourself. 
											People usually value things that are 
											in demand.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Getting 
										together with your ex love again, might 
										not be an easy task. But with 
										determination and hard work it can been 
										done.</div>
