			In this article, we’re going to talk about the common mistakes most 
			all men make when trying to get their girlfriend back. Pay close 
			attention because you’re probably doing at least some of these 
			things without even knowing it. If you want her back bad enough, 
			you’ll read on.<ol>
				<li><strong>Telling her you love her over and over again.</strong> 
				<p>Don’t act like a little puppy dog and beg for her back. 
				She’ll just lose respect for you and you’ll only end up pushing 
				her further away from you than she already is. A lot of guys 
				thing the reason she left them is because they didn’t verbalize 
				their love enough when in fact this is usually never true.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li><strong>Buying her flowers and other such gifts.</strong><p>
				Bribery isn’t going to work when getting your girlfriend back. 
				That’s actually how women interpret it you know. As bribery and 
				they think it’s pathetic. Save the flowers for the relationship; 
				not the breakup.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li><strong>Acting depressed and sad in order to make her feel 
				sorry for you.</strong> 
				<p>Acting like a little puppy dog isn’t going to win you any 
				points either. This just makes you look desperate and thus 
				pushes her further and further away from you. Man up and pull 
				yourself together.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li><strong>Generally being overly nice in order to “win her 
				over”.</strong> 
				<p>Again, acting overly nice will be interpreted by your ex as 
				you being a little puppy dog. I’m not saying you should suddenly 
				start acting like a jerk (that won’t get you anywhere either). 
				There is a line to be drawn and generally kissing up to your ex 
				girlfriend will only cause her to lose respect for you.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li><strong>Using guilt to get her back. Kids, money, etc.</strong> 
				<p>I see a lot of guys trying to manipulate their ex girlfriends 
				with kids, money and other such things. You can make her feel as 
				guilty as you want but that will not get back the one thing you 
				need in droves (attraction). This type of behavior will only 
				make her resent you all the more.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li><strong>Attempting to persuade her with reason and logic to 
				get back with you.</strong><p>Us men are very logical creatures. 
				We think that everything can be fixed logically. Attempting to 
				persuade your ex girlfriend to go back out with you (for 
				whatever reason) will only push her away. She doesn’t want to 
				hear logic, she wants to feel emotion. Emotion is the key.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li><strong>Doing absolutely nothing.</strong> 
				<p>And finally, doing absolutely nothing will definitely ensure 
				your failure. There are very specific steps you can follow to 
				get your ex girlfriend back. These steps are based on advanced 
				female psychology.</li>
			</ol>
			To sum everything up, you can’t use cheap manipulation that women 
			can see right though when attempting to get your ex back. Buying her 
			presents, using guilt, making her feel sorry for you, telling her 
			you love her (with an agenda), using logic and reason (when women 
			will only respond to emotion). Don’t feel bad though; almost every 
			guy going through a breakup does these things. There are plenty of 
			things you CAN do however.<p>&nbsp;</div>
