										People lose their girlfriends for many 
										reasons. There are even more ways to get 
										a girlfriend back. However, there are 
										some questions you should ask yourself 
										before endeavoring to get your 
										girlfriend back. Was the breakup really 
										entirely your fault? Do you really want 
										her back? Is she still interested in 
										you, or has she already moved on? 
										Frankly speaking, is there any real 
										chance of her coming back? 
										Unfortunately, general incompatibility 
										is one likely reason for a breakup that 
										is precipitated by a single major 
										incident. And making moves to get your 
										girlfriend back is a commitment unto 
										itself; the relationship will probably 
										change drastically after you really go 
										through the 'getting-her-back' grind. 
										Generally, you should be ready to take 
										some criticism because, depending on 
										whose fault the breakup was, there is 
										every chance of a major argument. And 
										most important, beware that a 
										“trophy-hunting” mentality generally 
										will get you nowhere. You have to want 
										her for who she is – not for the people 
										to whom you can show her off.<p>In the 
										final analysis, if you think she’s worth 
										trying to convince, then there are many 
										ways of patching things up. Apology 
										cards, or turning up at her home with a 
										box of chocolates to apologize is a very 
										acceptable strategy and often yields 
										impressive results. If something as 
										simple as this does the trick, consider 
										yourself lucky: you got off easy. If 
										this doesn’t work, and you still want to 
										go through with trying to get your 
										girlfriend back, more comprehensive 
										methods are required.</p>
										<p>One tasteful way to try to get a 
										girlfriend back is to call her and 
										invite her for a lunch date every couple 
										of months. During these lunch dates, do 
										not discuss anything heavy, or what came 
										to pass since the last lunch date. This 
										keeps you in her mind and sight and 
										recognizes you as an option in her 
										social and love life.</p>
										<p>And then there are the blatantly 
										manipulative approaches. For example, 
										the combination of your being okay with 
										your girlfriend leaving, along with her 
										knowledge that you have started dating 
										other women, is often enough for her to 
										come back. For some women, as long as 
										you are entirely hers, it is all a dull 
										and drab game. But as soon as the other 
										woman makes an entry into your world, 
										you become a trophy to be had. In fact, 
										you will be surprised at how different 
										his ex- or current girlfriend behaves 
										after being introduced to an attractive 
										office secretary.</p>
										<p>After a breakup and during a 
										patch-up, it isn't exactly necessary to 
										hound out the reason of the breakup. It 
										might have been either party’s fault. 
										What matters is that you display a 
										sincere desire to have her back.</div>
