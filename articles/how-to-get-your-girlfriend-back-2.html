				You’ve lost your girlfriend, huh? Don’t sweat it. Even men in 
				prehistoric times had difficulties getting and keeping women 
				without saying or doing something stupid. But here we are now, 
				in whatever year this is, and we as men still cannot keep a 
				woman from leaving them because we, as men, are generally dumb 
				when it comes to relationships. If you really, truly believe 
				that your girlfriend is the love of your life and you want to 
				settle down and start a family with her then by all means, 
				continue reading.<p>How to get your girlfriend back without 
				scaring her away? First and foremost, bombarding her with phone 
				calls, text messages, emails, voicemails and cologne covered 
				love letters will scare a girl away nine times out of ten before 
				she decides to come to her senses and rekindle your 
				relationship. Limit your attempts at contacting her to only once 
				a day, at a time when you know she can talk. Don’t call while 
				she’s at work or sleeping. If she doesn’t pick up, leave a cool 
				and collective message and give her 48 hours to respond. If she 
				doesn’t, try again. But remember, eventually if you have no 
				success, then maybe it’s time for another approach.</p>
				<p>How to get your girlfriend back without giving up what you 
				want? Once you are able to communicate with her, you must fix 
				the problems you two had without making fake promises or 
				expecting false hopes. Perhaps the breakup fight was about sex, 
				money, commitment, work, infidelity or just a slip of the 
				tongue. Whatever the case, make sure you are not promising 
				something you cannot live with. For example, if she cheated on 
				you and you are still bitter, don’t tell her that you forgive 
				her. You cannot have your relationship be fixed on a lie.</p>
				<p>How to get your girlfriend back with simple solutions? What 
				happened when you two first began to date? Did you always bring 
				her a red rose every morning? Did you tell her you loved her 
				everyday? Did you two always take a walk in the park every 
				Sunday? Chances are you two did something when you were still 
				blind in love that you no longer do because you have become 
				accustomed and maybe even bored with each other. Try to recreate 
				the things you used to do or try to start new traditions. If she 
				sees that you are trying so hard to bring back what was once a 
				great part of her life, she may regret slamming that door in 
				your face.</p>
				<p>Alright, so these were just three very simple but not 
				commonly used techniques for men to get a former girlfriend 
				back. How to get your girlfriend back is a question that has no 
				exact answer that cannot be found in an encyclopedia but life 
				experiences of men all over the world. If these tips help for 
				you, pass them along to other men and keep the dream alive 
				inside of every man.<br>
