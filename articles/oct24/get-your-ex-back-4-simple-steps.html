			      <p>How many times have you broken up with someone then  made up only to break up again? It's a vicious circle. This is the path  that many relationships take. Some relationships are doomed from the  start, while others can blossom and grow into something really  beautiful and lasting. The doomed relationships are the ones where we  rush into them with out thinking or really getting to know the other  person. These are usually the relationships based on the physical  attraction more than anything else. And these are usually the ones  where we run into trouble letting go. Think about it. What made your  past relationship so unforgettable? The answer is your ex. That's right  your ex. Your ex left their mark on you and you don't want to break  free. You want to recapture that flame that made your relationship so  hot. This may seem like an impossible task especially if your break up  was a bad one, but fear not for nothing is impossible.</p>
			      <p>The first  thing you must do is not to play the guilt card. You can't tell them  they can't leave if they really love you or you telling them how much  you love them making them feel so guilty they won't leave. These  tactics are unfair and they backfire on you. Conning someone into doing  what you want is wrong. This tactic can only end in tears your tears.  Whenever possible you want to end on a positive note and agree to  disagree and just be friends. Remember "If you love someone set them  free. If they return to you it was meant to be."</p>
			      <p>Instead you  throw your ex for a loop and kill them with kindness. If you see them  out speak to them and keep on going. Don't stand there and linger for a  lengthy conversation. You want them to think you are over it and have  moved on. Go to a regular hangout for you and your ex and let them see  you with someone else. If they see you have moved on that makes you all  the more appealing, because it is human nature to want what we can't  have. The lure of temptation is something that has plagued man since  the begining of time.</p>
			      <p>Next your ex will give you a call on the  pretext of seeing how you are doing. What they are really doing is  trying to feel you out. In other words they want to know if you have  really moved on or if there is still a chance for a reconciliation with  you. Keep your poker face on. Never let on how happy you are they  called and don't let your guard down atleast not yet. If they ask you  out say yes, but don't be eager.</p>
			      <p>Finally this is the chance you  have been waiting for. You must wear something sexy that will blow  their mind. When you're out and you both are talking to each other  really listen to what the other has to say. Many relationships fail  because of a lack of communication. This is your chance to finally  communicate. Remember communication is the key to a long and happy  relationship.</p>
