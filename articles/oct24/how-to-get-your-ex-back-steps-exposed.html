			        <p>You are devastated because she does not want to be  with you anymore? Maybe the situation appears hopeless, but in many  cases it is not. There is a great probability that you were the real  cause for the break-up.</p>
			        <p>In order to know what you should do to  fix the situation fast, you must understand how men attract women in  the first place. If you ask a woman about this, she would not be able  to explain how attraction works and you have to look deep into human  psychology to really understand why.</p>
			        <p>In Prehistoric times, women  were very unsafe and they should look urgently for protection,  preferably from some strong man to raise their children. Time passed  and now the word "strong" means something different depending on social  shapes that women get through the years and also depends on how old  they are. Young women tend to be more impressed by robust men, but  older women tend to be more impressed by money or power and if you try  to date a Christian girl, you better convert into a very religious  person. This creates the parameters that girls use to evaluate men all  the time.</p>
			        <p>This means that you should avoid, by all means, any  type of weak behaviour and this is the reason why you should stop  acting as a needy powerless man. Desperate behaviour like begging and  clinging will repel your lost love faster than a blink of an eye. While  break-ups are not easy, you should prove that this would not make you  cry (if you cry, do it behind closed doors).</p>
			        <p>This may seem  counterintuitive because all mothers teach nonsense to their sons  saying that girls want to receive gifts (this only proves that you need  to "BUY" her out, which girls see as a form of manipulation) and like  that men do whatever they want (do that and the girl will see you as a  powerless kid). There is an interesting side effect about being strong  and it is that all humans like challenges, so when you are not being  clingy, automatically you become a challenge and this could make your  loved one start chasing you instead of you chasing her.</p>
			        <p>Also, you  should try activities (not sex). The things that got your ex attracted  towards you the first time are still the best things that can get your  ex back.</p>
