			    <p>If you have experienced the anguish of a breakup in  your relationship, you know the feeling of emptiness and perhaps even  utter despair.</p>
			    <p>If your feelings have not abated for your love or  spouse you may find yourself spending endless hours trying to find a  way to get your ex back.</p>
			    <p>Friends will be perhaps the first source  of advice for you. They will give their views and advice on how they  would go about getting your ex back. Countless hours will be spent over  lunch, drinks, coffee and on the phone, figuring out what your ex is up  to and how to get her or him back.</p>
			    <p>Because you probably have more  than one friend, you will most likely get more than one theory or plan  on how to get your ex back.</p>
			    <p>Your mother may even chime in or  perhaps your pool man, mailman. hairdresser, mechanic, neighbor, dry  cleaner, and dog groomer, will all pitch in their 2 cents.</p>
			    <p>After a few weeks you will now have perhaps a dozen different &ldquo;ways&rdquo;  to get your ex back.</p>
			    <p>The  problem with the vast collection you have assembled is that they are  ALL WRONG! Well meaning, perhaps, but inexperience can mean disaster  for you and finish once and for all any effort to get your ex back.</p>
			    <p>This  is sad, because it really is possible to get your ex back, if you  understand what is going on and approach your ex with appropriate  attitudes, language, and actions.</p>
			    <p>Every friend, family member and  associate who is doling out information on how to get your ex back is  doing so based on what they tried, what they saw in a movie, read in a  magazine, watched on a daytime TV show or derived from some other venue.</p>
			    <p>Which  one of these inexperienced advice pals are you going to stake such an  important decision on, that of how to get your ex back?</p>
			    <p>Just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
			    <p>To get your ex back you need a step by step approach that is based on real life experience and is proven to work.</p>
			    <p>Your  ex may have a new love, may be remarried, playing the field, playing no  field at all, living down the street, or moved to Alaska and you live  in Florida.</p>
			    <p>Every type of relationship demands different methodologies for successfully winning the heart of your ex back permanently.</p>
			    <p>Only an expert  can provide advice tailored to your specific situation.</p>
			    <p>There are however a few rules that should be followed if you truly want to get your ex back</p>
			    <p>1)  Don&rsquo;t Beg- The more you beg your ex to come back, the less likely it is  to ever occur. People are funny. They tend to want what they don&rsquo;t or  can&rsquo;t have more than what they have without challenge.</p>
			    <p>2) Don&rsquo;t  Give Ultimatums- Comments such as &ldquo; leave me and I&rsquo;ll date your sister,  jump off the roof, run away and join the Navy&rdquo;, all make you look  silly. They don&rsquo;t make you desirable, just a fool. Use ultimatums and  your ex may help you pack&hellip;.and off to the Navy you&rsquo;ll go !</p>
			    <p>3)  Become Active in Something- By taking the focus off your ex and seeing  the world in a different perspective you will demonstrate your  independence, desirability, charm and those things that made you  desirable to your ex in the first place. Get active in your community,  join a club, go to church, join friends on a camping trip or start  hiking with your dog.</p>
			    <p>She or he, will soon hear that you are  doing just fine and will soon wonder why they broke up with you&hellip;.and  maybe even get a little jealous. Do this and retake charge of your  relationship, whatever stage your at.<br>
