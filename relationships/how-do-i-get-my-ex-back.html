		  <p>When your boyfriend or girlfriend comes out of the  blue and decides to break up with you, it can come as a serious hit to  your confidence and feelings. I doubt I really needed to tell you that,  but it's true...breakups really hurt. But what if there was a shot at  <a href="http://www.exboyfriendguru.com">getting your ex boyfriend back</a>, and picking back up where you left off? Would you  be interested? Of course you would, read on!          
          <p>There are a number  of things that could have gone wrong with your relationship that made  your partner want to leave, but the vast majority of them are actually  fixable. Some of them aren't, but most of them are. The biggest  problems in relationships that can be fixed are the ones within  yourself.</p>
          <p>Don't make the mistake of chasing after your ex right  after he/she breaks up with you...that's a bad idea and it could only  drive him/her further away. Give your ex some space, and sit down with  yourself. Analyze the relationship you had with your ex, and figure out  which of the problems that caused the breakup YOU were responsible for.  THOSE are the ones you can fix.</p>
          <p>Forget about trying to fix  anything that was wrong with your ex...nobody can change those things  but your ex him/herself. The only things you can really do anything  about are the things that you and you alone are responsible for: your  own actions and behaviors.</p>
          <p>Making sacrifices and compromises is  the name of the dating game, and it only makes sense that any  relationship is a combo of give-and-take. After all, there are two  people here who both require their needs to be met in order to be  happy...the key is finding a nice balance where you can make your  partner happy and remain happy yourself.</p>
          <p>So figure out the things  you did wrong. Those are the things you have to give on, to the point  where your partner could be happy with you. Really, it's good for you  anyways, because in the possible event that your partner isn't the  person you spend your entire life with, addressing these problems now  could mean relationship success in the future.</p>
          <p>So when you're  ready to start back in trying to get your ex back, after you've really  addressed the problems of which you're the main cause, you should start  off slow. The initial contact could be anything...an email, a phone  call, a text message...whatever you're most comfortable with. Above  all, the contact shouldn't be about getting back together, but just  about seeing how your ex has been.</p>
          <p>If you're really smooth about  how you go about it, your ex'll probably be okay with remaining in  touch. Try to be unassuming and generally relaxed...don't go on the  offensive to "win your ex back." That'll just make your ex want to  sever contact altogether. Build contact slowly, until eventually you're  spending time together again.</p>
          <p>Once you get to this point, it's  important to just enjoy your time together. Do things the two of you  always enjoyed before the breakup, it's good kindling for fond memories  and old feelings. Let your ex see how awesome it can be to be with you,  and allow the work you've been doing on yourself to speak for itself.</p>
          <p>Nine  times out of ten, the old <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_13309_know-you-love.html">love</a> between you isn't lost, just buried  beneath the hurt that all the problems in the relationship caused.  Since you're supposed to have dealt with your side of those problems,  there should be little in the way of your ex realizing how little point  there is to remaining your "ex." Follow this advice, and you have a  serious shot at saving your relationship.</p>
