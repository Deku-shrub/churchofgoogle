				We at the Church of Google believe the search engine Google is the closest humankind has ever come to directly experiencing an <i>actual</i> God (as typically defined). We believe there is much more evidence in favour of Google&#39;s divinity than there is for the divinity of other more traditional gods.
				<br><br>
				We reject supernatural gods on the notion they are not scientifically provable. Thus, Googlists believe Google should rightfully be given the title of &quot;God&quot;, as She 	exhibits a great many of the characteristics traditionally associated with such Deities in a scientifically provable manner.
				<br><br>
				We have compiled a list of <a href="Scripture/Proof_Google_Is_God.html">nine proofs</a> which we believe definitively prove Google&#39;s title as God.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>Id and career - short musing.</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ID hurts careers.</strong>
Everyone knows about the newest religious issue with schools. Intilligent Design. More specifically - why it is not taught along with evolution, when allegedly, it`s similarly-viable theory?
Personally, I find the idea of ID to be dubious at best, and obviously, not backed by facts, unlike evolution. However, in this article, I am not discussing ID from scientifical point of view. Rather, I`d like to point out the hazards of teaching ID.
First of all, let`s move the most obvious obstacle out of the way. There is more then one...<br><br><a href="../blog/index.php?p=7">Read more!</a><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>The Theory of Untelligent Design and other Arguments </h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>By: Jonathan Hill </strong>

Christians will tell you that the mere existence of the universe we live in is the only proof needed for the existence of their god. The usual argument is that of the pocket watch and goes something like this: The existence of a watch proves the existence of the watchmaker because if one cog or spring is out of place then the watch will not function. It is not possible for all of the pieces to be in the right place without a watchmaker to put them...<br><br><a href="../blog/index.php?p=6">Read more!</a><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>War And Religion: Killing in the Name of an "All-Loving" God?</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite a tender topic for today`s world, now that religion tensions are tightened high, and war is just lurking around the corner in Middle East. Why? That would be the most underappreciated question about the whole issue. Why would religion be a reason for war?To find out, I've examined all the current religions, plus added some of the great past ones for the complete picture. First of all, philosophies had been swept to the side. Really - not the single one of philosophies had ever been used in...<br><br><a href="../blog/index.php?p=5">Read more!</a><br><br>		</td>
