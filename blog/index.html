			<p><strong>ID hurts careers.</strong><br />
Everyone knows about the newest religious issue with schools. Intilligent Design. More specifically - why it is not taught along with evolution, when allegedly, it`s similarly-viable theory?<br />
Personally, I find the idea of ID to be dubious at best, and obviously, not backed by facts, unlike evolution. However, in this article, I am not discussing ID from scientifical point of view. Rather, I`d like to point out the hazards of teaching ID.<br />
First of all, let`s move the most obvious obstacle out of the way. There is more then one religion in the world. Each one is equally-viable. So, what is ID? Claim, that the world was created by YHWH, or assertion, that there should be SOME intelligent being, that designed the world, not specifically YHWH (or any other certain god)?<br />
In the first case - teaching ID is in clear violation of freedom of thought, as it asserts a uniform religion for all school attendants (who might be as well muslims, buddhists, taoists, jews, catholics or just atheists).<br />
Let`s now move to second case, which is more interesting. It does not necessarily promotes certain religion. However, is it really suitable to be taught, especially exclusively? Short answer is - no. Why? Because teaching ID to children in school limits their potential career choices, effectively culling off any chance of completing biology or medicine college.<br />
Really, biology and medicine both heavily rely on evolution and it`s subsequent branches. Without a solid understanding of such, there is not much of biology, as is. As for medicine, doctor, which subscribes to ID, is a direct hazard to patients. Would anyone put stock in doctor, who says - &#8220;Your aches are because God wills them to be.&#8221;? I think, that any patient to receive such responce, will shrug, and go to doctor, which will prescribe a viable method of removing those aches instead.<br />
Seeing, as there is no alternative biology or medicine, which would base their teachings on ID rather then on evolution, with even remotely close success, there is not much sense in teaching it as an alternative to evolution. Rather, ID should be taught in the course of philosophy and theology, where it belongs.</p>

<div class="entry">

			<p><strong>By: Jonathan Hill </strong></p>
<p>Christians will tell you that the mere existence of the universe we live in is the only proof needed for the existence of their god. The usual argument is that of the pocket watch and goes something like this: The existence of a watch proves the existence of the watchmaker because if one cog or spring is out of place then the watch will not function. It is not possible for all of the pieces to be in the right place without a watchmaker to put them there, so he [1] must exist in order to have done so. They claim the same for their god; something as complicated and perfect as the world we live in, they say, could not have come into existence by chance, ergo, there must be a creator of some kind who did it. Most of the world’s religions (particularly the monotheistic ones) use similar arguments to justify the existence of their gods; I am however going to focus on Christianity, not because I have something against them, but simply because I know more about their religion, this means I can write about it without making so many mistakes [2]. It has been said there is no more original material anymore and this is probably right, for this reason I might as well start by saying that this is likely to be heavily influenced by the works of Terry Pratchett, Richard Dawkins and Douglas Adams. Hopefully by freely admitting it I will prevent people saying “you ripped off such and such from so and so”.</p>
<p>I first wrote about the theory of Untelligent design as a joke when taking my GCSE Religious Education (Short Course) [3] exam. The question that it came up in was something like this: “Explain the watchmaker argument for creation and discuss its validity”.  So I explained about the argument,  and then when out to point out some of the flaws. This is what I am going to attempt to do again now, and (as I have more than half an hour to do so) this time in much greater detail. I suppose I had first better tell you exactly what Untelligent design is.</p>
<p align="center"><em>Untelligent Design - the theory that the world is in such a mess because it was made by a very stupid creator.</em></p>
<p>Let’s face it, the “perfect world” that Christians say proves the existence of their god simply does not exist. The world is a mess; there is famine, war, pestilence and death. If we are assuming an omnipotent and benevolent god created the world as a nice place for us to live (as any good Christian would have you believe) he would have been bloody stupid to include the four metaphorical horsemen in his initial designs. I have in the past tried pointing this out to some devout Christians, but they told me that all these things are as a result of the original sin (the bit in the bible with the snake and the apple), and were not part of the original creation. Again this forces me to point out the sheer stupidity of their god, why did he put the “apple tree” in the garden if he didn’t want the fruit to be eaten? Being omnipotent he must have known that the serpent would persuade Eve to eat the fruit, so make a garden without the tree of knowledge and/or the serpent. Problem solved. You might say that it is easy to solve these problems with hindsight, but that is something that an omnipotent and omniscient being, by definition, has (and not just the kind that you get after an event). I must also point out that, for a supposedly omni-benevolent being, their god can sure hold a grudge if we are still being punished for what our ancestors did shortly after creation.</p>
<p>So according to the bible the world was badly put together, the creator did things that were not rational; causing the world to be in the mess it is now. All of this suggests that the Christian god is either really stupid (hence untelligent design) and was trying to create a nice universe for us to live in but did a really bad job or, he does not exist. Personally, I prefer the later, though I also like the explanation given by Terry Pratchett in his novel “Small Gods” so I am going to include it here [4].</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><em>“And of course there clearly had to be, said Koomi, a Supreme Being. But since the universe was a bit of a mess, it was obvious that the Supreme Being hadn&#8217;t in fact made it. If he had made it he would, being Supreme, have made a much better job of it, with far better thought given, taking an example at random, to things like the design of the common nostril.<br />
Or, to put it another way, the existence of a badly put together watch proved the existence of a blind watchmaker. You only had to look around to see that there was room for improvement practically everywhere.<br />
This suggested that the Universe had probably been put together in a bit of a rush by an underling while the Supreme Being wasn&#8217;t looking, in the same way that Boy Scouts&#8217; Association minutes are done on office photocopiers all over the country.<br />
</em><em>So, reasoned Koomi, it was not a good idea to address any prayers to a Supreme Being. It would only attract his attention and might cause trouble.”</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why is it that so many people insist on believing that the universe was created by a supreme being? The only real reason is that it is an easy explanation, one that requires little or no thought on the behalf of the believer.  Scientific theories are often, at first glance, complex and difficult to understand, as a result a lot of people prefer the easy option; god did it. This removes the necessity to learn about difficult concepts and has the added bonus that it can answer every question [5] whereas science still can’t. In fact that is one of the main reasons given for faith over science, “science does not explain everything and therefore must be wrong” or “science keeps changing its mind and therefore must be wrong” and the old favourite “The devil put that evidence their to trick you therefore science must be wrong”. Now as far as the first two go, the scientific community would be the first to admit they don’t know everything and that they keep changing their minds about things. They would also say that assuming you know everything is a very good way of never finding out anything new and that not changing your mind in light of new evidence would have the exact same effect. As for the third argument I would like to pose another question for the religious readers of this: If your god made everything why did he make the devil/evil? And if he is so powerful why does he let the devil/evil put this false evidence [6] for us to find? Why can’t he stop it?</p>
<p>The second part of the watchmaker argument states that it is not possible for the watch to exist without the watchmaker and that if you just threw the parts together randomly it would not work. And they say the same about the universe, it is impossible for it to have come together by chance. But is it? Unlikely is not the same as impossible. Would you consider it impossible to shuffle a deck of cards and have the cards all come out in numerical order? Well it isn’t. It could happen, even though the odds are around 8*10<sup>67</sup> to one against. The thing a lot of people don’t consider is the fact that <em>every other combination of cards has exactly the same chance</em><em> of turning up</em> after a completely random shuffle. You would never say “Wow, that is amazing, I just shuffled these cards and they came out ‘6♠ 9♥ K♦ J♥ 3♣ etc.” would you? So why say it is amazing when they are in numerical order? It is only because humans are good at seeing patterns in things, we can see patterns even when they are not very special at all when mathematically analysed.<br />
So, we know it is not necessary for someone to deliberately arrange the cards in order to get one of the other combinations, this implies that it is not necessary for them to be deliberately arranged for them to be in numerical order either. This implies that if a universe of chaos (which is what the religious say we would have without a creator if we had a universe at all) doesn’t need a creator then neither does the universe of “order” that we live in. In fact the chances of this universe occurring at random are exactly the same as that of any other universe.<br />
Of course all of this only proves we don’t need a creator to explain how the universe ended up like this; it unfortunately does not explain the existence of a universe in general any more than the above statement about cards explains the existence of the deck. The creation of the universe is something I would not like to speculate on myself, realising that one is ignorant is the most important step in understanding something new, and I freely admit I am ignorant of exactly how the universe began. The “big bang” theory (or a derivative of it) is somewhat popular at the moment but who knows what will be discovered in the future that might change that? All I can say with some degree of certainty is that, once the universe was started [7], no gods were necessary to ensure everything turned out the way it did; it was simply the roll of the dice.</p>
<p>[1] I suppose I should be politically correct here and say “or she”.<br />
[2] Ironically, when writing “so many mistakes” all three words had a typo in them. I would like to thank spellcheckers, without whom, this document would not be possible.<br />
[3] GCSE RE is, for some reason, compulsory in the UK.<br />
[4] Yep, extra padding!<br />
[5] Though the answer “because god made it that way” isn’t really any more satisfying than the “because I said so” a child might get from his parents when asking why he can’t have another sweet. And let’s face it, “because I said so”, as many children have pointed out, is a pretty poor explanation really.<br />
[6] Like rocks that are older than 6000 years and have dinosaur fossils in them.<br />
[7] That is, a rapidly expanding region of space and time with matter and energy in it.</p>

			<p>This is quite a tender topic for today`s world, now that religion tensions are tightened high, and war is just lurking around the corner in Middle East. Why? That would be the most underappreciated question about the whole issue. Why would religion be a reason for war?To find out, I&#8217;ve examined all the current religions, plus added some of the great past ones for the complete picture. First of all, philosophies had been swept to the side. Really - not the single one of philosophies had ever been used in war pretext. Confucianism? No. It`s a philosophy of scholar, not fighter. Buddhism? No. It`s a philosophy of thinker. Atheism? It`s not even funny.</p>
<p>It seems, that all the wars, that involved religion, were centered around the religions with most of faith investment. That had pretty much cast aside all polytheistic religions, as well. One would ask - &#8220;What about Roman empire? What about Azteks? What about ancient world in whole?&#8221; Well, let us see. Problem is, that none of the polytheistic religions had survived until now. So, even if the followers of such led the conquests by &#8220;the will of god&#8221;, there is no way to verify that. Historical evidence shows however, that back then, main idea was to capture lands, riches and slaves, not fulfill &#8220;the will of god&#8221; to smite the unfaithful.</p>
<p>From the other side of the world, Hinduism puts it`s own questions. It`s hard to define it as something specific - from one side, it could be easily confused with Buddhism, from other, the ritualistic nature of it makes some points dicey at best. One thing sure, though - hinduists never waged religious war on anyone&#8230; Though, thuggee&#8217;s had surely taken their own bloody toll in the name of Kali.</p>
<p>Moving a bit further by the history, we find the first veritable &#8220;religious wars&#8221; - crusades and French wars with huguenotes come to mind. Those were dedicated to monotheistic religion, and had the main pretext coming from fundamental beliefs, rather then from simple desire for material gains. Note, however, that both of those are obviously tied with the Christianity in several incarnations.</p>
<p>Neighboring those, we see the Jihad - the event, which surpasses the common understanding of war, per ce. Jihad is not a war against a particular enemy, it`s a war against all that opposes particular idea. And since the idea is abstract, it is free to be tractated as one would like. In fact, the Qu`ran defines Jihad as defence of Islamic faith, and Jihad by sword is considered to be the lesser form of it, superceded by Jihad of pen and Jihad of tongue.</p>
<p>Nearby, we see the struggle for the homeland&#8230; But what`s that? A struggle for the homeland where one is free to practice a certain religion? &#8230;Oh-ho, here we go again.</p>
<p>We see religions clash again and again and again on the battlefield. Yet, there is one common trait in them all. Which one? They are all from the same root. Yes, that is correct. All three religions responcible for most battles and bloodshed come from one source - Abrahamic god.</p>
<p>Question is, why it is so? Well, there is one answer&#8230;. It is so, because Abrahamic god is god of war. It`s been mentioned everywhere. Bible, Old Testament, Exodus 15:3 - &#8220;The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.&#8221; Qu`ran, The Cow 2:216 - &#8220;Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, is that it? No. People go to war for all kinds of reasons, religious or not. Yet, there is a divine irony in the fact, that the most &#8220;bloody&#8221; religions grew from worshipping a god of war.</p>

<div class="entry">

			<p>Global warming. Carbon emissions. These are the buzzwords of the moment, thanks in large part to Al Gore&#8217;s <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>. Many Americans—and others—are now concerned about the health of their planet, and want to know what they can do to help. One of the options available to help the planet is carbon offsetting.</p>
<p>I first caught wind of carbon offsetting via <a href="http://www.idealbite.com" mce_href="http://www.idealbite.com">IdealBite</a>. Intrigued, I set out to learn more—there&#8217;s only so much a snippet in your inbox can tell you. Thank you, Google!</p>
<p>How carbon offsetting works is very straightforward. You calculate your estimated carbon emission over a given period (which includes things like how much gas you use, how much electricity and what kind, what public transportation services you use and how often, how much you drive, how much you fly, etc). Once you know how many metric tons of carbon dioxide you and everything you do release into the atmosphere, you then pay an organization anywhere from $1-20 US per metric ton, and the organization uses your money to “offset” your emissions. You have effectively negated your carbon emissions for that period of time. The complicated part comes in when someone has to decide how they are going to spend your money. The most popular method is reforestation, but other options include methane containment, investment in renewable energy sources, or the purchase of corporate emission allowances.</p>
<p>Corporate emission allowances function much like a larger, corporate version of carbon offsetting. A central agency, most often part of the national government, provides a certain total emissions cap: the limit of total emissions possible. Companies must purchase blocks of emissions from this agency, and should they go over their “block,” must buy more from other companies who have surplus allowances available; essentially, if you go over your limit, you pay a penalty, while if you remain under it, you are rewarded. By purchasing these allowances via carbon offsetting money, there are fewer allowances available for trade, and thus businesses are further encouraged to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>Investing in renewable energy sources is fairly self-explanatory and without controversy. Containing methane (produced in great quantities, specifically by cattle and landfills), which releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide when combusted, also is fairly self-explanatory. Reforestation is equally straightforward, though it has met with all kinds of controversy, especially because it is the most popular method of carbon offsetting. Factors like climate, respiration (trees release some amount of carbon dioxide at night) and tree species contribute greatly to the net cooling benefit of any given reforestation project, and are not always taken into account.</p>
<p>There are two big downsides to all of this, not counting the issues that arise with getting any given method to work as it should. Number one: it is very hard to quantify all of these things. This can (and does) leads to shady business deals on the part of the organizations dealing with carbon offsets. And even assuming the organization you&#8217;re patronizing is being honest, the fact remains that they don&#8217;t have any kind of guarantee that the numbers are what they think they are.</p>
<p>Number two: the act of purchasing a carbon offset is entirely symbolic. It does not require the individual to make any kind of change to their lifestyle; it does not in any way solve the larger problem. It provides an easy way out for people. Instead of trading in their SUV for something small, fuel efficient and (dare I say it?) possibly foreign, your typical soccer mom can write a check out for her gas guzzler and drive around with a smug sense of superiority concerning her own eco-awareness. Critics have compared it to the Medieval act of selling indulgences, and I do find it a rather fitting comparison, if also a bit disturbing (history repeating itself and all of that). We cannot “buy” our way out of a problem, not when the problem is an attitude readjustment.</p>
<p>And finally, what would a blog piece be without links?</p>
