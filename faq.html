  <p><em>By Matt MacPherson</em></p>
      
      <h3>Why do you worship Google as a God?</h3>
	<p>Because Google is the <em>closest</em> thing to a &quot;God&quot; that 
	humans can know and understand. We worship Google, and we can prove not 
	only does Google exist, but unlike any other god, <em>it exists as we know it</em>.<BR>
	  <script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
	<h3>Is there a Google afterlife?</h3>
	<p>By uploading our thoughts and opinions onto the Internet, our knowledge lives 
	on in Google's cache even after our death.</p>
	<h3>I always thought Google was a male search engine?</h3>
	<p>Search Engines don't have a gender, but there is a reason for our referring to 
    Google as a female: originally, religions of the past thought of Gods as 
	mainly feminine. It wasn't until monotheistic, Abrahamic religions such as Christianity, 
    Islam and Judaism entered the picture that the concept of "God" became purely masculine. </p>
	<p>You have been conditioned by your culture to view all Deities as male. The 
    Church of Google is simply carrying on the ancient tradition of viewing gods as feminine. 
    It's not part of any feminist agenda, nor an attempt at political correctness. It's 
    just us breaking a cultural taboo.</p>
	<h3>How can you worship a search engine over Jesus 
	  Christ/Allah/Zeus/Spaghetti Monster? It's just a computer program!</h3>
    <p> We will answer your question with another similar question: <em>Why do you 
      choose to worship your god over other gods? </em>The same amount of anecdotal evidence exists for all supernatural gods. You 
      cannot directly experience them, they all require faith, have holy 
      books associated with them (all claiming to be the one true word of God) and 
      generally, believers of these gods describe a "feeling" that their god is 
      watching over them.</p>
      <p>Believers in all supernatural gods describe the exact 
      same experiences and feelings without exception. Your God is in no way 
      different than any other supernatural god. You believe in it simply for the 
      comfort it provides you with, despite it being completely illogical. It is a 
      psychological tool you use to cope with reality.</p>
      <h3>What ideology is Googlism founded upon?</h3>
      <p>Googlism does not follow any particular ideology. We welcome all sorts of 
        differing views into our community. Googlism is simply the belief that 
        Google is the closest thing to a God our species has every directly 
        experienced. That&#39;s it.    </p>
      <h3>Google is man made and therefore cannot be God.</h3>
    <p>We completely agree with you. The 
      Christian God, Islamic God and Hindu gods are also man made concepts. They 
      exist only in the <i>imagination</i> of believers. We consider the belief in 
      invisible beings to be much more illogical than the belief in Google (as a 
      God).</p>
    <h3>But the Bible is proof our God is real.</h3>
    <p> The Bible is proof of nothing. It was written by men. Saying the Bible is the
      word of God because that's what the Bible tells you is a prime example of circular 
      reasoning. I might equally argue that Google proves itself to be a God as this very page 
      appears if you pray to Google for the phrase &quot;church google god&quot;.</p>
    <h3>So, if Google told you to go jump off a bridge, would you do it?</h3
      >
    <p>If someone told you that after you die, you&#39;re going 
        to live &#39;forever&#39; in peace and harmony in the sky, would you believe them?</p>
    <h3>Googlism hurts people by sending them to Hell.</h3>
    <p>First of all, we do not believe a &quot;hell&quot; exists. 
      Secondly, Googlismm has not started any religious wars, forced its opinions onto 
      others, discouraged critical thought, objected to harmless lifestyle choices and 
      most importantly, we have never attempted to scare people into believing they will 
      suffer if they reject our religion. Can you say the same for your religion? If you 
      reject Google as your God, nothing negative (aside from your search results being 
      crappy) will happen to you.</p>
    <h3>You're wasting your time on an idiotic and bogus religion.</h3>
    <p>Assuming you subscribe to Christianity, Islam, Judaism or 
      any of the other major religions: "Right back at you?". Worshiping an 
      invisible, nonexistent being is an equal, if not greater, waste of time.</p>
    <h3>It is possible to find bad things through Google, such as porn, 
      information on how to build a bomb, etc. Doesn't this make Google &quot;evil&quot;?</h3>
    <p> Much like Christians, Jews and Muslims claim of their God, Google offers us 
      all a <i>choice</i>. There are bad things in this world, and we must choose, 
      as individuals, to make the right decisions. The same is to be said about 
      searching. Google offers us <i>free will.</i></p>
    <h3>But can't Google's search results be manipulated sometimes? If Google 
      were a true God, She could not be manipulated.</h3>
    <p> And the Bible, Koran and Torah are not manipulated? Googlists would argue 
      that these books are some of the most mass manipulated works in existence. 
      Yes, unfortunately Google's search results can sometimes be manipulated, but 
      this is hardly anything new when it comes to religion.</p>
    <h3>This is blasphemy! How dare you mock religion like this!?!</h3>
    <p>The Church of Google believes we should be tolerant of everyone's beliefs, provided 
      said beliefs hurt no one. The statement above is not one of tolerance. In fact, the 
      statement above shows two of the deadly sins: Anger and Hubris, as well as breaking 
      some of the cardinal rule of Christianity as taught by Jesus: Love Thy Neighbor, and 
      Turn The Other Cheek. Strange then that we, a "parody" religion, follow the 
      philosophy of one of the most popular religions more closely than many of its followers.</p>
      <p>We are quite serious in our belief that Google is the closest mankind has ever come to 
      directly experiencing a Deity. We do not attack you for who or what you worship, you 
      should extend us the same courtesy.</p>
