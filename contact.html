<p>How many times have you broken up with someone then made up only to break up again? It's a vicious circle. This is the path that many relationships take. Some relationships are doomed from the start, while others can blossom and grow into something really beautiful and lasting. The doomed relationships are the ones where we rush into them with out thinking or really getting to know the other person. These are usually the relationships based on the physical attraction more than anything else. And these are usually the ones where we run into trouble letting go. Think about it. What made your past relationship so unforgettable? The answer is your ex. That's right your ex. Your ex left their mark on you and you don't want to break free. You want to recapture that flame that made your relationship so hot. This may seem like an impossible task especially if your break up was a bad one, but fear not for nothing is impossible.</p>

<p>The first thing you must do is not to play the guilt card. You can't tell them they can't leave if they really love you or you telling them how much you love them making them feel so guilty they won't leave. These tactics are unfair and they backfire on you. Conning someone into doing what you want is wrong. This tactic can only end in tears your tears. Whenever possible you want to end on a positive note and agree to disagree and just be friends. Remember "If you love someone set them free. If they return to you it was meant to be."</p>

<p>Instead you throw your ex for a loop and kill them with kindness. If you see them out speak to them and keep on going. Don't stand there and linger for a lengthy conversation. You want them to think you are over it and have moved on. Go to a regular hangout for you and your ex and let them see you with someone else. If they see you have moved on that makes you all the more appealing, because it is human nature to want what we can't have. The lure of temptation is something that has plagued man since the begining of time.</p>

<p>Next your ex will give you a call on the pretext of seeing how you are doing. What they are really doing is trying to feel you out. In other words they want to know if you have really moved on or if there is still a chance for a reconciliation with you. Keep your poker face on. Never let on how happy you are they called and don't let your guard down atleast not yet. If they ask you out say yes, but don't be eager.</p>

<p>Finally this is the chance you have been waiting for. You must wear something sexy that will blow their mind. When you're out and you both are talking to each other really listen to what the other has to say. Many relationships fail because of a lack of communication. This is your chance to finally communicate. Remember communication is the key to a long and happy relationship.</p>
